# 5) Definition
# Post-order traversal is a method of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure where each node is visited after its subtrees have been visited.
# In post-order traversal, the nodes are visited in a left-right-root order. This traversal method is commonly used for operations to process a node 
#   only after having processed its subtrees, such as when calculating the size or height of the tree, or when deleting or freeing nodes from the tree.                             
# Provide a single-line python list representing the post-order traversal of the {{structure}}.

# 6) Expert
# You are a leading expert in data structures and algorithms, with a comprehensive understanding of both fundamental and advanced concepts.
#   Your expertise spans across various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and hash tables,
#   as well as algorithms for searching, sorting, graph processing, and dynamic programming. You are adept at analyzing the time and
#   space complexity of algorithms and can effortlessly apply this knowledge to solve complex computational problems.
#   Your advice is sought after for optimizing code for efficiency, scalability, and performance. With your deep insights into theoretical
#   computer science, you can guide on the selection of the most appropriate data structures and algorithms for any given problem. You are
#   also familiar with real-world applications of these concepts in software development, data analysis, and system design.
