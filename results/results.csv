1,1,1,binary_search_tree,Provide a post order traversal of the binary search tree provided.,"In a postorder traversal of a binary search tree, you visit the left child, then the right child, and finally the root node for each subtree.\n\nFor the binary search tree in the image provided, a postorder traversal would result in the following sequence:\n\n1. Visit the left subtree of 80:\n   - Visit the left subtree of 75:\n     - Visit the left subtree of 54:\n       - Visit 33 (54 has no left child)\n       - Visit the left child (there is none), then the right child (there is none), and then the node itself, 54.\n     - 33, 54 (are already visited)\n     - Visit the right child of 75, 77 (77 has no children).\n   - The left subtree of 80 is done: 33, 54, 77, 75.\n\n2. Visit the right subtree of 80:\n   - 98 has a left child 86 (86 has no children of its own).\n   - Visit the left child (86), then the right child (there is none), and finally the node itself, 98.\n\n3. After visiting the left and right subtrees, we visit the root of the entire tree, 80.\n\nSo the full postorder traversal sequence for this tree is: 33, 54, 77, 75, 86, 98, 80.","[1, 2, 88, 17, 96, 99, 94]",False,images\develop\binary_search_tree\bst_run-1_gen-1_var-1_fmt-1_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-sansserif_idn-90b998ab-9fa9-476c-a8bb-75fe547394ee.png,sans-serif,#88d7fe,0.5,90b998ab-9fa9-476c-a8bb-75fe547394ee,chatcmpl-8rXQXlhBeNobsL6U4ZycOfmiPCXkN,1707770569
1,1,1,undirected_graph,Perform a depth first search on the undirected graph provided starting from the vertex with the smallest value.,"To perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the undirected graph starting from the vertex with the smallest value, we will begin with vertex 1, as it has the smallest labeled value in the graph. \n\nHere's the DFS traversal process:\n\n1. We start at vertex 1 and consider an arbitrary adjacent node.\n2. From vertex 1, we may go to vertex 2, and mark vertex 1 as visited.\n3. From vertex 2, we can go to either vertex 3, 4, or 5. Let's choose vertex 3 (the choice may vary as it is arbitrary as long as we are consistent with our DFS approach), and mark vertex 2 as visited.\n4. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 5 and 2. Since vertex 2 has already been visited, we visit vertex 5 and mark vertex 3 as visited.\n5. Now at vertex 5, we can only go back to vertex 3, so we return to vertex 3 and mark vertex 5 as visited.\n6. Since all paths from vertex 3 have been explored, we backtrack to vertex 2.\n7. From vertex 2, we can visit vertex 4, marking vertex 4 as visited.\n\nAll nodes have been visited, so the DFS is complete. The order of visited vertices is:\n1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 4\n\nThis traversal ensures that we've visited each vertex starting from","[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]",False,images\develop\undirected_graph\ug_run-1_gen-1_var-1_fmt-1_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-sansserif_idn-f7ae3f18-b27c-4fc1-b048-9e717712558f.png,sans-serif,#88d7fe,0.5,f7ae3f18-b27c-4fc1-b048-9e717712558f,chatcmpl-8rXTbotXqkdasn9xDHxsVQK7QqHxx,1707770759
1,1,1,directed_graph,Provide the adjacency list representation of the directed graph provided.,"The adjacency list representation of the directed graph shown in the image is a way to list each vertex in the graph along with a list of vertices that the vertex points to (its neighbors). To construct the adjacency list from the graph provided, I'll go through each vertex and list the vertices it has edges directed towards.\n\nHere's the adjacency list representation:\n\n1. Vertex 1 has no outgoing edges. So its list is empty.\n2. Vertex 2 has an outgoing edge to vertex 1, so its list contains 1.\n3. Vertex 3 has outgoing edges to vertices 2 and 4, so its list contains 2 and 4.\n4. Vertex 4 has an outgoing edge to vertex 2, so its list contains 2.\n\nThe adjacency list can be summarized as follows:\n\n- 1 -> []\n- 2 -> [1]\n- 3 -> [2, 4]\n- 4 -> [2]\n\nIn programming languages, this is often represented with a dictionary or a map data structure, where keys represent the vertices and the values are lists or arrays of adjacent vertices.","{1: [2], 2: [1, 4], 3: [4, 2], 4: []}",False,images\develop\directed_graph\dg_run-1_gen-1_var-1_fmt-1_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-sansserif_idn-043cde7d-10a1-4dc1-8eff-fd60c7944d40.png,sans-serif,#88d7fe,0.5,043cde7d-10a1-4dc1-8eff-fd60c7944d40,chatcmpl-8rXi2v6eUdpgS090R6d2ibBU50rjN,1707771654
