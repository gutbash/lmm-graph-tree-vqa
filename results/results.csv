1,1,1,binary_tree,Provide a post order traversal of the binary tree provided.,"To perform a postorder traversal on the binary tree provided, you visit nodes in the following order: left child, right child, and then the parent node. Here's how it will proceed for the tree you've provided:\n\n1. Start with the root node (56).\n2. Traverse the left subtree of (56), which has (36) as the root.\n3. Traverse the left subtree of (36), which has (38) as the root.\n4. Since (38) has a left child (27), visit (27) first as it has no children (27 → 38).\n5. Return to (36) and visit its right child (39) since (39) has no children (27 → 38 → 39 → 36).\n6. Having completed the left subtree of the root node, return to the root node (56) and traverse the right subtree with (37) as the root.\n7. Visit the left child of (37), which is (6), since it has no children (27 → 38 → 39 → 36 → 6).\n8. Now visit the right child of (37), which is (29), as it has no children (27 → 38 → 39 → 36 → 6 → 29).\n9. Having visited both children of (37), visit (37) itself (27 → 38 → 39 → 36 → 6 → 29 → 37).\n10",images\develop\binary_tree\bit_run-1_gen-1_var-1_fmt-1_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-sansserif_idn-a8e20568-d1fe-4478-9e26-f99a7215c87b.png,sans-serif,#88d7fe,0.5,a8e20568-d1fe-4478-9e26-f99a7215c87b,chatcmpl-8rJJkD68Lo9mPHO7SGvyvVg9PKKRR,1707716332
1,1,2,binary_tree,Provide a post order traversal of the binary tree provided.,"In post-order traversal, you visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. For the binary tree provided in the image, the post-order traversal would be as follows:\n\n1. Traverse the left subtree of the root (56):\n   - Traverse the left subtree of node (36):\n     - Visit node (38):\n       - Visit node (27) since it's the left child of node (38).\n       - Since node (38) doesn't have a right child, we now visit node (38) itself.\n     - Visit node (39) since it's the right child of node (36).\n   - Since we've visited left and right children of node (36), we now visit node (36) itself.\n\n2. Traverse the right subtree of the root (56):\n   - Visit node (6) since it's the left child of node (37).\n   - Visit node (29) since it's the right child of node (37).\n   - Since we've visited left and right children of node (37), we now visit node (37) itself.\n\n3. Visit the root node (56) since both its left and right subtrees have been traversed.\n\nSo, the post-order traversal for this binary tree would be: 27, 38, 39, 36, 6, 29, 37, 56.",images\develop\binary_tree\bit_run-2_gen-1_var-1_fmt-2_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-serif_idn-ff2cc0d8-392d-48f3-b640-18fff7f7bbb1.png,serif,#88d7fe,0.5,ff2cc0d8-392d-48f3-b640-18fff7f7bbb1,chatcmpl-8rJJvbNhztBlyObMOTgDYMSk459i1,1707716343
