1,1,1,binary_tree,Provide a list representing the post-order traversal of the binary tree.,"The post-order traversal visit nodes in the order of left child, right child, and then the parent.

1,1,1,binary_search_tree,Provide a list representing the post-order traversal of the binary search tree.,"In post-order traversal, each node is processed after its left and right subtrees, which means the algorithm visits the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the root node at the end.

1,1,1,undirected_graph,Provide a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the undirected graph.,"To represent the adjacency list of the given undirected graph through a dictionary, where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, it would look something like this:\n\n```python\ngraph = {\n    1: [2, 5, 6],\n    2: [1, 3, 4, 7],\n    3: [2, 6, 7],\n    4: [2, 5, 7],\n    5: [1, 4, 6],\n    6: [1, 3, 5],\n    7: [2, 3, 4] \n}\n```\n\nThis dictionary represents an undirected graph, so for example, vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 5, and 6.
