It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. In this case, we begin at vertex 3. There is only one edge connecting 3 to 2, so 2 is added to the list. Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, so we add 1 to the list. Finally, vertex 1 connects to vertex 4, so we add 4 to the list. Therefore, the BFS traversal is: [3, 2, 1, 4]. Note: Since there is no cycle in the given graph, we do not need to keep track of visited vertices.
