1,1,1,binary_tree,Provide a single-line python list representing the post-order traversal of the binary tree.,"The post-order traversal for the given binary tree is a depth-first traversal where you visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the node itself. Based on the tree in the image, the post-order traversal would be:\n\n`[88, 85, 23, 27, 13, 98, 67, 64, 38, 93]`","[88, 85, 23, 27, 13, 98, 67, 64, 38, 93]",True,images/develop/binary_tree/bit_run-1_gen-1_var-1_fmt-1_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-sansserif_idn-853397a5-8613-46aa-af50-af5726d94837.png,sans-serif,#88d7fe,0.5,853397a5-8613-46aa-af50-af5726d94837
