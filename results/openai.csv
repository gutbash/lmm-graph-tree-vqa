1,1,1,binary_tree,Provide a list representing the post-order traversal of the binary tree.,"The post-order traversal of a binary tree involves visiting the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. According to the image provided, we would visit the elements in this order:\n\n1. Visit the left subtree of node 46, which is node 67.\n2. Then, visit the left subtree of node 67, which is node 11. Since 11 is a leaf node, there is no further subtree, so add 11 to the list.\n3. Next, we visit the right subtree of node 67, which is node 59. This is also a leaf node, so add 59 to the list.\n4. With both subtrees of node 67 visited, we now add 67 to the list.\n5. Moving back to the root, we now visit the right subtree, which is node 16. As it is a leaf node, we add 16 to the list after visiting both of its non-existing subtrees.\n6. Finally, we add the root node 46 to the list.\n\nTherefore, the post-order traversal list will be: [11, 59, 67, 16, 46]","[11, 59, 67, 16, 46]",True,images\develop\binary_tree\bit_run-1_gen-1_var-1_fmt-1_thk-05_clr-88d7fe_fnt-sansserif_idn-abaddcef-112a-4f82-923c-98e3a9f50790.png,sans-serif,#88d7fe,0.5,abaddcef-112a-4f82-923c-98e3a9f50790

1,1,1,binary_search_tree,Provide a list representing the post-order traversal of the binary search tree.,"To perform a post-order traversal of the binary search tree shown in the image, visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the node itself. The traversal order would be as follows:\n\n1. Visit the left subtree of the root (84):\n   - Visit the left subtree of 67:\n     - Visit 11 (which is a leaf node, so we can list it immediately).\n   - Since 67 has no right subtree, visit 67 itself.\n   - Visit the right subtree of 52:\n     - Visit the left subtree of 59:\n       - Visit 49 (which is a leaf node).\n     - Since 59 has no right subtree, visit 59 itself.\n   - Since there's no more nodes to visit in the right subtree of 52, visit 52 itself.\n2.
