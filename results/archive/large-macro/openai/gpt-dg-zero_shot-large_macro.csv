We add vertex 1 to our BFS queue.- Now we've explored all the neighbors of vertex 3, and since vertex 3 doesn't have other outgoing edges, we move to vertex 1.- From vertex 1, we go to vertex 5 since that's the only vertex it points to. We add vertex 5 to our BFS queue.- Vertex 1 is now fully explored, so we move to vertex 5.- From 5, we can go to vertices 4 and 6, so we add both to our BFS queue in that order.- Now we've explored all edges from vertex 5, and we move onto vertex 4.- Vertex 4 doesn't have any outgoing edges that lead to unvisited vertices, so we move to vertex 6.- Vertex 6 has an edge to vertex 2, but since vertex 2 doesn't have any incoming or outgoing connections with other vertices in our traversal, the BFS ends here.The BFS traversal starting at vertex 3 would therefore give us the following list of visited vertices in order:```[3, 1, 5, 4, 6, 2]```","[3, 1, 5, 4, 6, 2]","[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]",False,33.33333333333333,sans-serif,#ffff00,o,5.0,-|>,6,7,"{1: [5], 2: [], 3: [1, 6], 4: [6, 5], 5: [4], 6: [2]}",512,06593773-ddcb-4506-97ae-8cd3f0736606,91473bd3-34ff-407d-bca0-6c4a0600176e

Here's the BFS traversal starting from vertex 6:1. Start at vertex 6.2. Visit all the neighbors of vertex 6 in an order that follows the smallest to the largest vertex number (if there's a rule or convention as such).Following the BFS procedure, here's the traversal:- Start at vertex 6.- Then visit vertex 2 (since it's the only direct neighbor of vertex 6).- From vertex 2, visit vertex 5 (which is the neighbor of vertex 2 that hasn't been visited yet).- From vertex 5, visit vertex 3 (the next unvisited neighbor of vertex 5).- Finally, visit the remaining vertices which do not have any incoming edges from the already visited vertices. These are vertex 1 and vertex 4.Hence the BFS traversal order starting from vertex 6 is [6, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4].Represented as a list in Python syntax: `[6, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4]`","[6, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4]","[6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",False,33.33333333333333,sans-serif,#ffffff,o,1.0,-|>,6,10,"{1: [3], 2: [4], 3: [5, 6], 4: [1, 2], 5: [2, 6], 6: [1, 2]}",512,673d3eef-a703-41cd-8c4f-915a6a54e4c9,ae1c99f8-9c35-4161-95b4-0173cb1589c1

Now, since vertex 5 has no other connections leading from it, we backtrack to vertex 8.Backtracking to vertex 8 doesn't give us any other vertices that lead out, so we backtrack again to vertex 2. From vertex 2, we can go to vertex 3. Vertex 3 leads to vertices 7 and 9; let's say we choose to go to vertex 7 first. After reaching vertex 7 and finding no other vertices connected to it, we backtrack to vertex 3 and then proceed to vertex 9, which is the end of that path as no new vertices can be reached from it.Lastly, we go back to vertex 3 and then to vertex 2, where we have explored all possible paths that lead out from vertex 2.Here is the list representing the DFS traversal from vertex 2:```[2, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9]```Each vertex in the graph is visited once, and when there are no new vertices to visit from the current vertex, the traversal backtracks to the previous vertex.","[2, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9]","[2, 8, 5, 9, 7, 3, 6, 4, 1]",False,44.44444444444444,sans-serif,#ffff00,o,1.0,-|>,9,10,"{1: [], 2: [8], 3: [6, 9, 5], 4: [1], 5: [9], 6: [4], 7: [3], 8: [5], 9: [7]}",512,e43bc852-e5ec-43cf-b80e-deccc0008108,7d2de7f4-6fb4-41ef-b6f8-d4a24227d09a
